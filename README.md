**data science execution (EDA.ipynd file)**
**powershell**
Let's get your virtual environment activated properly! Since Git Bash has been tricky, let's switch to PowerShell—which is more reliable on Windows:

🧭 Step 1: Open PowerShell in your project folder
In VS Code, go to Terminal → New Terminal and select PowerShell from the dropdown beside the plus button.

Make sure you're in your student_performance_predictor folder (it should contain the .venv directory).

🔓 Step 2: Allow script execution (if needed)
PowerShell often blocks scripts by default, which can prevent activation. Run this once to allow activation scripts:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
No admin rights needed.

⚙️ Step 3: Activate your .venv
Still in PowerShell, run:

powershell
Copy
Edit
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
This should change your prompt to show:

scss
Copy
Edit
(.venv) PS C:\...\student_performance_predictor>
✅ Step 4: Confirm the environment is active
Run:

powershell
Copy
Edit
where python
Make sure it points to something like:

makefile
Copy
Edit
C:\... \student_performance_predictor\.venv\Scripts\python.exe
— and not your global Python installation.

📦 Step 5: Install dependencies
Now that you're in the right environment, install your packages:

powershell
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
🔄 Step 6: Reload VS Code and restart kernel
Press Ctrl+Shift+P, type Reload Window, and press Enter.

Open your EDA.ipynb, select the .venv kernel, then click Restart Kernel (🔄 icon).

🧪 Step 7: Test your notebook
Run this cell:

python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd
print(pd.__version__)
If it shows a version without errors, you're good to go! 🎉

Why PowerShell works best here
Activation in Git Bash using . .venv/Scripts/activate sometimes fails silently.

PowerShell allows .ps1 scripts by default with the adjusted execution policy, making activation smooth.

Let me know:

Does the prompt update to (.venv)?

What does where python show?

Whether imports run smoothly in the notebook?
